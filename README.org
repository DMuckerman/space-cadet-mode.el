* Space Cadet Mode

space-cadet-mode is a minor mode for Emacs inspired by the Greek and Math layer keyboard mappings from [[http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/][this post]].
Instead of having to rely on Alt+hex key combos for Unicode input, which don't work out of the box with Emacs (or maybe at all), this minor mode transforms F17 and F18 into temporary modifiers to enable the Greek and Math layers, respectively.

** Using space-cadet-mode

To use space cadet mode, you can put it somewhere in your emacs load path, and then make sure that
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'space-cadet-mode)
#+END_SRC
is called.

space-cadet-mode does not currently enable itself for any modes by default, and only provides the minor mode, making it up to the user to decide which modes they want to enable it for, which can be done like the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun turn-on-space-cadet () (space-cadet-mode 1))
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-space-cadet)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'turn-on-space-cadet)
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-space-cadet)
(add-hook 'mu4e-compose-mode-hook 'turn-on-space-cadet)
#+END_SRC

space-cadet-mode also supports typing the characters as their LaTeX symbols while in a few different modes (org-mode, LaTeX-mode and latex-mode by default), to make for easier exporting using LaTeX.
This can be turned on by settings `space-cadet-org-latex-chars` to `t`.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq space-cadet-org-latex-chars t)
#+ENd_SRC

When used with [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Special-symbols.html][org-mode's ability]] to display the LaTeX symbols as their UTF-8 equivalents, the mode acts very much like it does elsewhere.

In order to make space-cadet-mode print the LaTeX symbols in another mode, add it to space-cadet-latex-modes-alist:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'space-cadet-latex-modes-alist '(TeX-mode . ""))
#+END_SRC

Then just reload your config, or restart Emacs, and you should be good to type!

Currently, the Control-[ mapping is disabled for the Math layer because it translates to Escape, thus, it overrides the Escape key, making using Emacs a tad problematic.

The Control-arrow bindings are enabled, but can clash with OSX's space-switching key bindings, so use at your own peril.

** Disclaimer

Being my first real attempt at doing anything remotely seriously in elisp, and my first attempt at writing a minor mode, this is some messy, hacky stuff. There's probably better, Emacs-ier, lisp-ier ways of doing things for this project. And hopefully I'll find them. But for now, take caution in enabling it, since it may clobber single-letter key-mappings, among other things.
